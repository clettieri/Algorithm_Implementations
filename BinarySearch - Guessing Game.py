Binary Search - Pick a Number Guessing Game!

In this game you will define a range from 1 to n.
Then you must pick a number in that range.
The computer will tell you how many guess at most it will
need to guess your number.

Each guess the computer makes the user will say if their number
is higher, lower, or exactly right.

This game is a demonstration of binary search.
Binary search find's an element in a sorted list by continually halving
the search space until the element is found.
