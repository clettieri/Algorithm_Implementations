"""
Selection Sort

Selection sort takes an array and sorts it from smallest
to biggest by looping through each value of the array and
finding the smallest value to place at index 0.  It then
loops through a subarray starting at index 1 to find the next
smallest value and place it at index 1, This looping over a 
subarray will continue until all items are sorted.
